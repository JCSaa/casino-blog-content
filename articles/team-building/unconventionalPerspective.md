# Unconventional perspective

William Wallace, Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Pope Francis, Che Guevara, Richard Branson… Most people wouldn’t know that these leaders fit the description of unconventional thinkers, and here are 7 best practices of their unconventional way of earning trust, loyal following and effectiveness on accomplishing their goals.

1. Take the blame - If there is a blame to be had, take it on. If there is a credit to be given, give it away to others. It’s a rare behavior that truly creates trust and loyalty; Always protect your team and praise them when it comes to owning up to their accomplishments.

2. Forget about conventional wisdom - The more you say “it’s never been done” before, the more excited your team gets about changing that fact. It’s hard to manage a team of rebels, but that’s exactly what’s needed to change the norm, to challenge the old, and invent the new.

3. Mistakes are never Failures - The only thing that matters is the response to those mistakes. Mistakes teach, while the notion of “failure” erodes confidence. Pioneers and trailblazers stumble while shaping new paths. And that’s okay.

4. Shut Up - “The art of effective conversation lies in listening.” Make it a point to not have your opinion heard right off the bat, sit back and listen. You will get amazing insights and inspire great ideas just by listening. It is hard to do, but tremendously rewarding to exercise this often.

5. Intentionally seek diversity - We've all seen “leaders” surround themselves with “yes” people, it is human nature to like those that look, speak, think or dress like us. Instead, seek diversity of opinions, ages, genders, perspectives, and experiences. Don’t build an army of men and women to adapt to you, build a diverse team where you must adapt to them, enriching the collective DNA of experience. Remember, "If everyone is thinking the same, then most aren’t thinking at all."

6. Encourage reverse mentorship - Be sharp enough to know that times change and that no one person can know everything. Encourage reverse mentorship with younger generations, realizing that there are things younger professionals are just smarter about and are critical conditions of innovation.

7. Disappear - Disconnect and reflect for a while, change the routine, learn something outside your professional interest. Create white space in which reflection thrives. Know your limits, and the limits of your team and when their energy levels need recharging to continue to operate successfully for the long run.
